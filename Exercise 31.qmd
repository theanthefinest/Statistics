\$ 1. \quad \text{Construct a frequency distribution for the data.} \$

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

data <- c(67, 84, 80, 77, 97, 59, 62, 37, 33, 42,
36, 54, 18, 12, 19, 33, 49, 24, 25, 22,
24, 29, 9, 21, 21, 24, 31, 17, 15, 21,

26, 33, 14, 14, 16, 22, 26, 10, 16, 24)

# Determine the Class, Data contains 50
class <- 1 + log2(50)
print(class)

# Find the class weighd
class_weighd <- ceiling((max(data)- min(data))/6)
print(class_weighd)

# Dermine the frequency distribution
breaks <- seq(min(data), max(data)+class_weighd, by = class_weighd)
freq_distribution <- cut(branch_Top, breaks = breaks, right = FALSE)
freq_table <- table(freq_distribution)
print(freq_table)

```

\$ 2. \quad \text{Construnct a histogram for the data } \$

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

hist(data, breaks = breaks, 
     main = "Histogram of Number of Library Branches", 
     xlab = "Number of Branches", 
     ylab = "Frequency", 
     col = "skyblue", 
     border = "black")
```

\$ 3. \quad \text{Describe the shape of the histogram} \$
